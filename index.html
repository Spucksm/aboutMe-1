      <h4>Bio</h4>
      Hey there, my name is Kason Braley. I live in Arizona with my fiance and two dogs. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran, I spent four years as an Avionics Technician. I have been separated from the military for two years now. I transitioned to the IT field immediately and started in a help desk/ system administration position. I was introduced to PowerShell a little over a year ago and that is what started me on this software developer journey. I recently became very interested in the Web Development space and I believe it will be a great fit for me once I hone my skills.
